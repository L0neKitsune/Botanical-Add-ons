# Ideas

### Functional trees
    need mana to grow (will drop saplings?)
* Holy Oak - Produces fruit(costs mana) that can be used to make Divinity splash potions
* Lux Wood - Glows (tree and planks made from it)
* Nether Oak - Fire resistant (sustaining?)
* ??? - Blast resistant wood
* ??? - Anti (Mana Seal?) Creeper - potentially prevent mana pool drain if I implement it


### Extension methods or helpers for commonly used snippets of code
### Expandable Tree-gen


### Colored Chests
* support for simple upgrades?? - e.g. size
* trap chests? - zaps player if they try to open it


### More Mobs - need models
* Mana Seal Creeper (Replace with Mana Wraith)?
    * tracks down pools
    * drains player mana / gives debuff
    * drops debuff crafting item / mana crystals (if it absorbs enough mana)
    * aggros automatically to players with mana reserves
* Friendlier Potatoes - +10 to adorbs


### Splash Potions
    Add a method of creating splash potions for some effects likely using mana glass panes to make bottles
    each tier would be an item with x uses so you only had to do one infusion for x uses cost would be tiered as well
        - mana = 3
        - alf = 6
* Poison
* Wither
* Mana Seal
* Divinity - Damages undead
