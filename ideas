# Ideas

### Functional trees
    need mana to grow (will drop saplings?)
* Holy Oak - Produces fruit(costs mana) that can be used to make Divinity splash potions
* Lux Wood - Glows (tree and planks made from it)
* Nether Oak - Fire resistant (sustaining?)
* ??? - Blast resistant wood
* ??? - Anti (Mana Seal?) Creeper - potentially prevent mana pool drain if I implement it
* ~~Ward Wood - prevents mobs from crossing (e.g. warding stones thaumcraft) may have sustaining cost~~
    * ~~Wire's comments: Naaaaaah, warded blocks aren't a fun time code-wise and sometimes bug out~~
* Donar Oak - acts as a lightning rod, used for thundercaller rod??
    * Wire: But... you can't make a block be a lightning rod, can you?
    * L0ne: You should be able to intercept events in an area
    I think it would be cool to use the lightning charged wood as a crafting ingredient plus oaks are thors tree

### Extension methods or helpers for commonly used snippets of code
### Expandable Tree-gen
### Crafting mechanic for trees
    probably fairly expensive since trees can drop saplings
* multi-block
* incorporates botania flowers / vanilla blocks
* api

### Colored Chests
* support for simple upgrades?? - e.g. size
* trap chests? - zaps player if they try to open it


### More Mobs - need models
* Mana Seal Creeper (Replace with Mana Wraith)?
    * tracks down pools
    * drains player mana / gives debuff
    * drops debuff crafting item / mana crystals (if it absorbs enough mana)
    * aggros automatically to players with mana reserves
* Friendlier Potatoes - +10 to adorbs
* ~~Boss Mob ?~~

### Gated Lexica Pages
    Have tiered lexica entries to avoid duplicating sections (Good example would be unlocking info about thor ring
        upgrades to the rod of the thundercaller without needing to add a new entry)
    May do a pull request for this

### Splash Potions
    Add a method of creating splash potions for some effects likely using mana glass panes to make bottles
    each tier would be an item with x uses so you only had to do one infusion for x uses cost would be tiered as well
        - mana = 3
        - alf = 6
* Poison
* Wither
* Mana Seal
* Divinity - Damages undead

### ~~Botanists Bane - "Imagine Breaker"~~
    An unholy relic of an ancient time, merely having this weapon on your person is enough to completely drain any
    personal reserves of mana, damaging mana based armor and cursing you with a powerful mana seal (10:00 sustained/no milk???),
    however this is not its true purpose.  Striking a botanist with this weapon will do large amounts of damage increasing relative to there personal store of
    power(full pool = 10 hearts), as well as cursing them with a long lasting mana seal(1:00).

Wire's comments: Don't do this, man. Touma's arm doesn't like being cut off.
        Also, malicious magic v. other players isn't a botanist's thing. It's to everyone or noone.
